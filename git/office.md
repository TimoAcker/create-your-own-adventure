[You are sitting at your desk at the office. Suddenly you realize, that the person next to you isn't human!
It's a small tree which "wears" a trench coat, and these hair are tentacles!

The look on your face tells the eight-armed mollusc that he has been uncovered and so he jumps of the tree
and trys to flee into the direction of the next best ocean.


Your colleagues start to scream:

"Holy Haskell! Panik! The impossible happend!"
"Hey! You can't do an octopus!"
"It is in detached head state!"
"Fetch him! Merge him into his origin master branch!"
"Help me Sarah! Tell me what to doooo!"
"Someone get the sea buggy, in case it gets to the ocean!"


You don't know what to do, and so, to find your inner
Amiga, you sit down, start a guru meditation and pray:

"GitHub, into your repository I commit my code."
